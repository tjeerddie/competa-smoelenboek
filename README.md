# Competa Smoelenboek

First clone the repository from github and then open your cmd and write ``` npm i && bower i ```, this will install all npm devDepencies and bower dependencies.  
You also need to use XAMPP or WAMPP to make a server on port ```8080``` and import the sql file from ```public/resources/models/db/smoelenboek.sql``` to phpMyAdmin.  
If you have done that, then run ```grunt serve```, this will run grunt and will open your browser with ```localhost:8080```;

This is what you all need to do to run Competa smoelenboek.
